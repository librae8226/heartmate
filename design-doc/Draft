Rough Design
============

v0.1
----
Brief:
    Heartmate makes it possible for connecting heart rate sensor to the internet
    over WiFi, a single module binding to finger or ear.
    On the server side (cloud service), we could perform data processing and
    give feed back to the guardians of the patients/elders.
Issues:
    1. Hard to make the size small enough and it could leads to high power
    consumption because of internet connection. (fixed on v0.2)
    2. Cannot ensure that wearing such a device all the time is comfortable.

v0.2
----
Brief:
    Make it connective over Bluetooth 4.0 BLE. It might significantly reduce the
    power consumption. And the personal healthcare center could be something
    likea watch or a phone, etc. (Pebble?)
    And the sensors for human body health caring/monitoring together with the
    personal healthcare center can make up a network by Bluetooth.
    Then the personal healthcare center connect to the internet for uploading.

Issues:
    Burndown from v0.1, cannot ensure comfortability while wearing the sensors.
